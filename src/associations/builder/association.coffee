    # @note In Rails, this method is defined much like `@define_readers` because
    #   operator overloading exists in Ruby. However, because operator overloading does
    #   not exist in Javascript, we must define `assign()` methods for associations. But,
    #   because singular association targets are assigned as variables to their owner model,
    #   whereas collection association targets are wrapped in a proxy, we must define the
    #   `assign()` methods in different ways. Singular association assignment is defined on
    #   the owner model as `assign_[target_klass]()`, whereas collection association
    #   assignment is defined on the proxy object, as `assign()`
